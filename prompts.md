# AI Prompts Log

**Project:** Prodesk IT Landing Page
**Date:** January 12, 2026

## Session Summary
AI usage was strictly limited to syntax verification, advanced CSS keyframe generation, and debugging browser-specific behaviors. The core HTML structure and design logic were hand-coded. AI acted as a documentation reference for Tailwind configuration and Web APIs.

## Key Prompts Used:

1.  **Tailwind Configuration:**
    * "Correct syntax for extending the default Tailwind color theme within the `<script>` tag configuration object to add custom 'brand' and 'dark' palettes."

2.  **CSS Animation Math:**
    * "Generate CSS keyframe percentage values for a smooth 'blob' animation that translates X/Y coordinates and scales slightly for a breathing effect."

3.  **API Boilerplate:**
    * "Basic syntax for the JavaScript `IntersectionObserver` API to toggle a CSS class when an element enters the viewport."

4.  **Glassmorphism Compatibility:**
    * "What are the required vendor prefixes for `backdrop-filter` to ensure the frosted glass effect works on Safari/Webkit browsers?"

5.  **Logic & Best Practices:**
    * "Best approach to prevent 'theme flashing' on page load when using LocalStorage for Dark Mode persistence."
